C++ Keywords

Keywords are reserved to the compiler for use by the language. You cannot define classes, variables, or functions that have these keywords as their names. The list is a bit arbitrary, as some of the keywords are specific to a given compiler. Your mileage may vary slightly:

    auto
    break
    case
    catch
    char
    class
    const
    continue
    default
    delete
    do
    double
    else
    enum
    extern
    float
    for
    friend
    goto
    if
    int
    long
    mutable
    new
    operator
    private
    protected
    public
    register
    return
    short
    signed
    sizeof
    static
    struct
    switch
    template
    this
    throw
    typedef
    union
    unsigned
    virtual
    void
    volatile
    while
